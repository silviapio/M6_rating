# M6_rating
## Rationale
The rating is composed by 5 gray hearts. When the mouse is over a certain heart, that heart and all the hearts on its left turn red. If the mouse moves out of the hearts, the hearts turn gray again. If a heart is clicked, the red hearts are kept fixed, and change only if a different heart is clicked.
